1 Project Overview

“A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.”
– Winston Churchill

In [this article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/04/machine-learning-fake-news-accuracy.html), George McIntire conducted an experiment using a Naive Bayes classifier to classify "fake news" articles with an 88% accuracy. Inspired by this experiment, the [author](https://github.com/lutzhamel/fake-news/blob/master/report.md) recreated it using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and a binary document-vector model, achieving a 97% accuracy with a 95% confidence interval of [96%, 98%].
As I delved into the intricacies of this approach and endeavored to grasp the complexities of the approach, I attempted to find a more straightforward solution to develop a sophisticated and highly accurate system for detecting "fake news" using advanced deep learning techniques.

1.1 Project Objective

The objective of the Fake News Detection Capstone Project was to develop an effective and accurate model for detecting fake news articles using machine learning algorithms. The project aimed to address the challenge of distinguishing between real and fake news in order to promote reliable information and combat misinformation.

1.2 Outline of Solution

The solution approach for the Fake News Detection Capstone Project involved utilizing machine learning techniques to classify news articles into two categories: "Real" or "Fake." The project employed a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning methodologies to build an accurate and efficient fake news classifier.


2 Solutions Development

2.1 Data Sample

For the development of the project, I utilized two datasets, namely "FakeNewsTrain.csv" and "FakeNewsTest.csv," which were provided in Brightspace. These datasets contained news articles labeled as "1" for "Real" news and "0" for "Fake" news. The datasets were pre-processed and curated to ensure data quality and integrity.

2.1.1 Data Sample Cohort Definition

The data sample used for analysis in this project was sourced from two CSV files: "FakeNewsTrain.csv" and "FakeNewsTest.csv." These datasets were provided through Brightspace, an online learning platform, as part of the AI foundation course.
The combined dataset consists of a total of N = 20800 rows and M = 5 columns, where N represents the number of news articles, and M denotes the various attributes or features extracted from each article (title, author, text etc). The dataset was structured to include the following information for each news article:
Text Content: The text body of the news articles.
Label: A binary classification indicating whether the news is "Real" (labeled as "1") or "Fake" (labeled as "0").
The sample encompasses articles from various sources, gathered to represent a diverse range of news items. While the exact dates of the news articles are not explicitly mentioned, the dataset is assumed to be collected over a certain period, ensuring a representative sample from that timeframe. The data does not pertain to a specific restricted population; instead, it aims to cover a broader scope of news articles that are commonly encountered in real-world scenarios.

2.1.2 Data Quality and Data Exclusions

During the initial exploration of the dataset, several data quality issues were identified, and appropriate steps were taken to address them to ensure the integrity and reliability of the analysis:

Missing Values: The dataset was checked for missing values in both the "Text Content" and "Label" columns. Fortunately, no missing values were found in these critical fields. As a result, no imputation or deletion of rows was necessary.

Data Consistency: To maintain data consistency, the "Label" column was reviewed to ensure that all values were binary and correctly represented "Real" (1) or "Fake" (0) labels. Any inconsistent or erroneous label entries were rectified to guarantee accuracy in the subsequent analysis.

Data Balance: It was important to check for class imbalances in the dataset to avoid bias during model training. The distribution of "Real" and "Fake" news articles was evaluated to ensure that both classes were adequately represented. If an imbalance was detected, data augmentation techniques or resampling methods were considered to balance the classes.

Outliers: While the nature of the dataset may not typically involve numerical outliers, it was important to inspect for any unusual or extreme entries that could potentially impact the analysis. If outliers were found, they were appropriately handled, either by confirming their authenticity or by addressing them through suitable techniques.

Duplicate Entries: Duplicate news articles, if present, were identified and removed to prevent redundancy in the dataset, ensuring that each article contributed uniquely to the analysis.

2.1.3 Definition of Behavioral Features

In the Fake News Detection Capstone Project, behavioral features will be utilized to analyze and classify news articles as either "Real" or "Fake." These features encompass a range of characteristics and patterns present in the articles, enabling the model to learn and distinguish between genuine and misleading news. Below are the defined behavioral features:

Textual Content: The main body of the news articles represented as a sequence of words or tokens, providing critical information for analysis.

Word Count: The total number of words in each news article, which may indicate distinct writing styles and patterns associated with fake news.

Title-Body Consistency: A binary feature denoting whether the title and body of the news article align in terms of content, helping identify potential contradictions or misleading information.

Source Reliability: A categorical feature reflecting the reliability and credibility of the news source, aiding in distinguishing articles from trustworthy and untrustworthy publishers.

Named Entities: The presence and frequency of named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) within the news articles. Fake news might contain fictitious or misrepresented entities.

Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment scores indicating the emotional tone of the article. Fake news might utilize extreme emotions to manipulate readers.

Grammatical Structure: Features related to the grammatical structure of sentences, such as punctuation patterns, sentence lengths, and the presence of specific grammatical constructs.

Publication Date: The date of article publication, which could be relevant in understanding time-sensitive events and identifying outdated or fabricated news.

External Links and References: A binary feature indicating the presence of external links or references supporting the information presented in the article. Fake news might lack credible external sources.

Social Media Engagement: Metrics representing the article's popularity on social media platforms. Fake news might spread rapidly due to clickbait titles or sensational content.

Fact-Checking Tags: A binary feature indicating whether the article has been flagged or fact-checked by reputable organizations.

Note: The behavioral features serve as informative representations of news articles, facilitating the detection of fake news through pattern recognition and analysis of various characteristics.
